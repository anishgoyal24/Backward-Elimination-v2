# Backward-Elimination-v2
Slightly modified version of Backword elimination approach.

This is slightly different, efficient and faster than the traditional Backward Elimination algorithm.

Pass the features(X) followed by the labels(y) and the significance level you want to consider into the eliminaton function. It will return the optimised dataset.

NOTE: No need to pass the dataset with the variable column already added. It will automatically add the column.

Import the following libraries for the code to work properly.

import pandas as pd

import statsmodels.api as sm

import numpy as np
